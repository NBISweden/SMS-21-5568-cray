# NBIS Support \#5568-cray

This is the home of the NBIS support project with the Redmine issue \#5568,
*"Single cell-RNA sequencing for identifying hemocyte subpopulations"*.

A Conda environment specification is provided in the environment.yml file and
a Nextflow workflow allows reproducibility of the analyses. Data is not stored
in this repository.

## Reproducibility

The transcriptome FASTA and BLAST XML files used in these analyses come directly
from the SÃ¶derhall group's previous work, while the mitochondrion genome can be
found at the [NCBI website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_033509.1/).
The analyses can be reproduced using either Docker or Conda.

Nextflow is run from it's own conda environment whether using docker, singularity, or conda packages.
```bash
conda install -n nextflow-env nextflow
conda activate nextflow-env
nextflow run ...
conda deactivate nextflow-env
```
### Using Docker

Public images are used where possible

```bash
# Run the pre-processing workflow
nextflow run . -profile uppmax,docker -entry pre_processing

# Run the analysis workflow
nextflow run . -profile uppmax,docker
```

### Using Conda

```bash
# Run the pre-processing workflow
nextflow run . -profile uppmax,conda -entry pre_processing

# Run the analysis workflow
nextflow run . -profile uppmax,conda
```
